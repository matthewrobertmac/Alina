    aboutme: `Experienced language teacher with a passion for creative writing and a talent for translating poetry. Fluent in English, Ukrainian, and Russian, I have spent years honing my teaching skills and immersing myself in the beauty of language. My love for languages extends beyond teaching, as I thoroughly enjoy writing poems and translating them to and from various languages. Currently, I am expanding my linguistic repertoire by learning Spanish.

    My teaching methods combine cultural understanding with interactive and engaging lessons, fostering an environment that encourages language exploration and creativity.
    
    Outside the classroom, my true joy lies in creative writing. I find immense satisfaction in crafting captivating poems that touch the hearts of readers. The ability to express emotions and ideas through words is a gift I cherish.
    
    Driven by a deep passion for words and language, I am eager to take on new challenges and opportunities that allow me to create and write. Whether it be crafting my own works or breathing life into the words of others through translation.
    
    If you have a project that requires linguistic expertise, a creative touch, and a dedication to preserving the essence of the written word, I would love to connect and collaborate. I'll help you to promote your brand and sell any kind of product by writing articles & posts to your or your brand's social media!`,
